# ImpernentLoss_calculator

Into DEFI there are Automated Market Maker - AMM. If you have a pair of token you can become liquidity provider, thus we will receive rewards for our contribution.

I want to implement a script that will calculate the real profit of a position in a pool. For this, the algorithm will rely on impermanent loss, rewards and auto-composition.
Next, I would like to treat a leveraged position like on impermax,tarot,alpaca,alpha homora.
